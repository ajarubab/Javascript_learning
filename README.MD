3. Install the LIVE SERVER extension to see real time changes of our code in chrome browsers console area.

5. For mac [command + k ] key clears the inspect console area in chrome.

6. [ control + ~ ] opens the integrated terminal of vs code.

7. To save our learnings in github repository
    
    a. Login to your git hub account and create a new repository "Javascript Learning".
    b. On PC/Laptop, create a folder "JS learning", open it with vs code editor.
    c. make an index.html file and a first.js file.
    d. embed the script tag with src of first.js file.
    e. click on "Go Live" option of vscode editor which appears in bottom right corner.
    f. In vs code editor, open its integrated terminal.

8. We can run our javascript code without HTML file also, but it would require node installed in our system.
9. if node is installed, just make a .js file with any console line and to run it open the integrated teminal
    of vs code and type the     >>> node filename.js    and press enter, we will see the output of our js code.
